            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>
              &nbsp&nbsp&nbspAvul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, popularly known as A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, was an Indian scientist and the 11th President of India. He was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India, and passed away on July 27, 2015, in Shillong, Meghalaya, India.<br>

Abdul Kalam was born into a humble Tamil Muslim family. His father, Jainulabdeen, was a boat owner and Imam of a local mosque, while his mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife. He came from a financially disadvantaged background but had a strong desire to learn and a great passion for science since childhood.

&nbsp &nbsp &nbspKalam completed his schooling in Rameswaram and then studied physics at St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli. After graduating in 1954, he moved to Madras (now Chennai) to pursue aerospace engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology (MIT). During his time at MIT, Kalam developed an interest in aeronautical engineering and worked on various projects.<br>

After completing his studies in 1960, Abdul Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) as a scientist. He played a crucial role in the development of India's first indigenous satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III) and the country's first nuclear-capable ballistic missile (Pokhran-II). His contributions to India's defense and space programs earned him the nickname "Missile Man of India."

Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) from 1992 to 1999. He played a pivotal role in India's nuclear tests in 1998, which established India as a nuclear power.<br>

In 2002, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India, serving from 2002 to 2007. He became known as the "People's President" due to his humility and connection with the common people of India. During his presidency, he focused on promoting education, youth development, and the eradication of poverty.

After his presidency, Kalam continued to be actively involved in education and inspirational activities. He delivered lectures and interacted with students and young professionals to motivate them to pursue their dreams and contribute to the development of the nation.

A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was a highly respected and beloved figure in India and internationally. He received numerous awards and honors, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, in 1997. He authored several books, including "Wings of Fire" and "Ignited Minds," which inspired and motivated millions of people, especially the youth.<br>

Abdul Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, after suffering a cardiac arrest while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. His death was mourned by people across the nation, and he left behind a lasting legacy as a scientist, visionary, and inspirational figure.
